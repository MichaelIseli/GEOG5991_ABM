# GEOG5991_ABM
This is the code produced following the practical exercises during the GEOG5991 module at the University of Leeds. The module is part of my MSc GIS studies.

# Functionality of the ABM
The model is written in python language (3.6). It consists of agents that randomly move around and eat up their environment as they go along. (The do however not explode quite unlike Mr. Creosote). The components of the model are the environment, which is raster information read in as a .csv file and of course the agents roaming around randomly whilst nibbling away their surrounding. Once agents come too close of each other they have to “share” the environment.

# Challenges faced building and running the ABM
Being new to coding I faced a number of issues that cost me a lot of time. On the desktop PC used at work PyScripter is installed and we are encouraged to work with this IDE because ArcGIS model builder works with python 2 (a fact I clearly did not enough attention to initially). Due to the IT security rules at the organization, one cannot install other software.
Once I installed Spyder on a personal laptop things started to shape-up though and long nights started to pay off.

# Summary
I learned during the module that the coffee consumption expands exponentially with the progression of the module. Luckily I did not take up smoking again - even though the temptation was omni-present.
It would be fair to say that the module was, while extremely valuable, a quite sobering experience.
